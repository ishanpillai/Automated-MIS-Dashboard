# Login MIS Automation System

## Overview

This project is an automated Excel-based Management Information System
(MIS) built to streamline reporting and performance tracking in the
insurance and banking channel partner domain. Designed and implemented
using advanced Excel formulas, the system eliminates manual data entry,
reduces reporting errors, and enables quick decision-making through
automated dashboards and business summaries.

## Key Features

### 1. RM Summary

• Provides a consolidated view of all Bank RMs (Relationship Managers)
and ARMs (Assistant RMs).\
• Automatically calculates total business done by each RM/ARM,
product-wise distribution, and performance comparison.\
• Uses dynamic lookup formulas and conditional formatting to highlight
top and low performers.

### 2. Login Summary

• Captures and summarizes all logged cases across products.\
• Automatically computes credit eligibility for each RM/ARM based on
product name, APE (Annualized Premium Equivalent), and PPT (Premium
Payment Term).\
• Integrates multiple cross-sheet references (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and
IF-AND-OR combinations) for real-time calculations.\
• Enables instant productivity and accuracy tracking for business logs.

### 3. T vs A (Target vs Achievement)

• Built for internal tracking and performance analysis.\
• Tracks product count, product mix, and monthly target achievement.\
• Employs SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and dynamic range formulas to auto-update
metrics.

## Excel Automation Logic

The system leverages a combination of advanced Excel functions
including:\
• IF, AND, OR --- Conditional logic for eligibility and validation.\
• VLOOKUP / INDEX-MATCH --- Dynamic data retrieval between sheets.\
• SUMIFS / COUNTIFS --- Multi-criteria aggregation for reports.\
• TEXT, ROUND, CONCATENATE --- Standardized formatting and
presentation.\
• Dynamic Ranges & Data Validation --- Ensure accuracy in inputs.\
• Conditional Formatting --- Visual indicators for performance and
anomalies.\
\
Together, these create a self-sustaining Excel automation model that
recalculates all metrics automatically when new data is entered.

## Business Impact

• Reduced manual reporting time by over 70%.\
• Achieved error-free automation across key business reports.\
• Enabled real-time insights for RM performance, product mix, and sales
analytics.\
• Enhanced collaboration between Sales, Operations, and Management
teams.
